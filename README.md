# Stream

  StreamApp is providing a StreamFactory class whic is used for creating streams with optional compression and encryption functionalities. 
  
  The GetWriteStream method can be used to obtain a writable stream with compression and/or encryption applied or the GetReadStream method to obtain a readable stream with decompression and/or decryption capabilities.
  
  This implementation simplifies the process of working with streams while offering flexibility in data processing and security. Additionally, comprehensive unit tests are included using Xunit to ensure the reliability and correctness of the functionality.
