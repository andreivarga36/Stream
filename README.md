# Stream

  StreamApp is a utility library providing a StreamFactory class for creating streams with optional compression and encryption functionalities. Users can utilize the GetWriteStream method to obtain a writable stream with compression and/or encryption applied, or the GetReadStream method to obtain a readable stream with decompression and/or decryption capabilities.
  
  This versatile implementation simplifies the process of working with streams while offering flexibility in data processing and security. Additionally, comprehensive unit tests are included using Xunit to ensure the reliability and correctness of the functionality.
